//! # `omni-crypto`
//!
//! Cryptographic primitives for OMNI OS.
//!
//! This crate wraps battle-tested cryptographic libraries from the
//! `RustCrypto` family (see <https://github.com/RustCrypto>) behind
//! OMNI-specific typed APIs. It provides the composition layer (typed
//! keys, nonces, ciphertexts) — it does **not** invent algorithms.
//!
//! ## ⚠️ Status: `AWAITING_CRYPTO_REVIEW`
//!
//! This crate has not yet been reviewed by an external cryptographer
//! (P3.2 in `/todo.md`, blocked on funding via P4). The implementation
//! follows established RustCrypto APIs with RFC test vectors for every
//! primitive, but no public auditor has signed off on the composition
//! layer. Do not use the output of this crate in adversarial settings
//! until that review lands.
//!
//! ## Design rationale
//!
//! 1. **Use libraries; do not write crypto.** Every primitive delegates
//!    to a well-reviewed implementation. This crate is the typed
//!    composition layer.
//! 2. **Strict, opaque error types.** Cryptographic failures map onto
//!    [`omni_types::OmniError::Crypto`]. Error messages never expose
//!    key material, plaintext, or correlation hints.
//! 3. **Constant-time on adversarial paths.** AEAD tag verification and
//!    signature verification go through [`subtle::ConstantTimeEq`] (or
//!    the equivalent inside the wrapped library). Equality comparisons
//!    on keys/MACs/tags MUST NOT use `==`.
//! 4. **`Zeroize` on every secret.** Keys, shared secrets, and any
//!    intermediate buffer that holds key material implements
//!    [`zeroize::Zeroize`] and wipes itself on `Drop`.
//! 5. **Algorithm agility.** Cipher suites are negotiated, not
//!    hardcoded. Sunset dates for deprecated algorithms are tracked in
//!    `/docs/04-security-model.md` § "Crypto agility".
//! 6. **`no_std + alloc`.** Like the rest of the foundational layer.
//!
//! ## Module map
//!
//! | Module | Phase | What |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`aead`]    | P1.2 | Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (`ChaCha20-Poly1305`, RFC 8439). |
//! | [`signing`] | P1.2 | Digital signatures (`Ed25519`, RFC 8032). |
//! | [`kex`]     | P1.2 | Key exchange (`X25519`, RFC 7748). Hybrid PQ in Phase 4. |
//! | [`hash`]    | P1.2 | Cryptographic hashes (`SHA-256`, `SHA3-256`, `BLAKE3`). |
//! | [`kdf`]     | P1.2 | Key derivation (`HKDF-SHA-256`, `Argon2id`). |
//! | [`fpe`]     | P4   | Format-preserving encryption (placeholder). |
//! | [`snark`]   | P4   | Zero-knowledge predicates (placeholder). |
