//! OIP-007 §6 — Undo/rollback window.
//!
//! Non-destructive actions performed in `Autonomous` mode are recorded in
//! a 30-second rollback window. Within that window, the user can undo
//! the last action. After 30 seconds the entry expires and can no longer
//! be rolled back through this mechanism.
//!
//! Only reversible actions are tracked here. Destructive actions (which
//! require at least `Guided` mode per OIP-007 §3) bypass this window.
//!
//! See OIP-007 §6 and OIP-Agent-Arch-022 §S4.
