//! Per-CPU descriptor scaffold — MB14.a foundation for MP/AP enable.
//!
//! Extended in MB14.b with `IA32_GS_BASE` / `IA32_KERNEL_GS_BASE` wiring
//! and a GS-relative [`current_cpu`] accessor, then in MB14.c.2.d with
//! a sibling `AP_SLOTS` array so every logical CPU has a stable per-CPU
//! descriptor reachable by `lapic_id` lookup.
//!
//! ## Scope (MB14.a + MB14.b + MB14.c.2.d)
//!
//! - **`BSP`** is initialised from [`init_bsp`] after
//!   [`super::lapic::lapic_init`] has succeeded.
//! - **`AP_SLOTS`** is an array of [`MAX_CPUS - 1`] descriptors, one per
//!   Application Processor. The BSP populates the slots pre-fire via
//!   [`register_ap`]; the AP itself reads the slot pointer the BSP
//!   stamped into `super::mp_ap_entry::AP_RUNTIME_CONTROL` and parks
//!   it in its `gs:[0]` via `wrmsr` (MB14.c.2.d landing code).
//! - **`GS_BASE` per-CPU pointer (MB14.b).** [`init_gs_base`] writes the
//!   address of the supplied descriptor into the two GS-base MSRs:
//!   `IA32_GS_BASE` (`0xC000_0101`, active in kernel mode) and
//!   `IA32_KERNEL_GS_BASE` (`0xC000_0102`, shadow swapped in on
//!   `swapgs`). The descriptor stores a self-pointer at offset 0 so a
//!   single `mov rax, gs:[0]` returns the active `&'static PerCpu`.
//! - **No AP startup.** Only the BSP's LAPIC ID is recorded. Application
//!   processors land in MB14.c (INIT-SIPI-SIPI handshake with a real-mode
//!   trampoline).
//!
//! ## Why now
//!
//! MB13 closed the `omni-capability` integration cycle (ADR-0006) and the
//! kernel is single-CPU end-to-end. The driver model (P6.7) needs:
//! 1. cross-CPU TLB shootdown (broadcast `invlpg`), which presupposes
//!    a way to identify the local CPU and address sibling cores;
//! 2. per-CPU schedulers / run-queues, which need a per-CPU storage slot
//!    addressable in constant time from any kernel context.
//!
//! Both require a stable per-CPU descriptor reachable by a constant-time
//! instruction sequence. MB14.b makes that sequence a single `gs:[0]`
//! load, agnostic to which CPU is executing the code path.
//!
//! ## Why atomics
//!
//! The four fields are `core::sync::atomic` even though MB14.b touches
//! only the BSP. The descriptor is intentionally `Sync` so that future
//! AP code can populate sibling slots — in an `[PerCpu; MAX_CPUS]`
//! array — without taking a global lock on the cold paths.
