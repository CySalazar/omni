//! MB14.d — TLB shootdown via broadcast IPI on vector `0xFD`.
//!
//! When the BSP modifies a kernel-half mapping (the kernel half is shared
//! by reference across every per-process PML4 — see [`super::address_space`]
//! ADR-0004 § 4) every other logical CPU may have stale TLB entries
//! covering the affected virtual range. Linux pattern: write the target
//! VA range into a shared descriptor, broadcast a Fixed-delivery IPI on a
//! dedicated vector, and busy-poll an ack counter the handler increments
//! after issuing `invlpg` locally.
//!
//! ## Scope (MB14.d)
//!
//! - Vector [`TLB_SHOOTDOWN_VECTOR`] = `0xFD`, installed in the global
//!   kernel IDT by [`super::idt::idt_init`] hook in MB14.d closure.
//! - Shared [`Shootdown`] descriptor (atomic VA + page count + ack +
//!   generation). Single-writer (BSP) under MB14.d; future MB14.e will
//!   serialise multiple writers via a kernel-level spinlock per the
//!   ADR-0007 roadmap.
//! - [`flush_tlb_range`] entry point: local `invlpg` loop on the BSP,
//!   then `ipi::send_to_all_except_self(0xFD)` + busy-poll the ack
//!   counter against [`super::per_cpu::registered_ap_count`].
//! - 0xFD ISR (asm trampoline + Rust callback) reads the descriptor,
//!   issues `invlpg` per 4 KiB page, EOI's the LAPIC, then `fetch_add(1)`
//!   on the ack counter.
//!
//! ## Why a separate generation counter
//!
//! With multiple in-flight shootdowns (Phase 2 territory) an AP must not
//! ack a previous-generation request — otherwise the BSP races on stale
//! acks. The handler reads `generation` once at entry and acks against
//! that snapshot; the BSP busy-poll predicate is
//! `ack_for_generation == registered_ap_count()`. MB14.d only emits one
//! shootdown at a time (BSP is single-threaded outside IRQs) so the
//! generation field is informational, but the wire is laid for the
//! Phase 2 lock + queue.
//!
//! ## Why this lives outside `mm`
//!
//! `mm` (added later in MB14.d) re-exports [`flush_tlb_range`] as a
//! one-liner so callers say `mm::flush_tlb_range(...)` per the kernel
//! house style; the implementation stays here next to the LAPIC + ISR
//! plumbing.
