//! Kernel-side NET service-channel registry.
//!
//! Maintains the canonical mapping `interface_name → (ChannelId,
//! EventChannelId)` for every NIC driver that has registered an
//! `omni.svc.net.<iface>` command channel and the accompanying
//! `omni.svc.net.<iface>.evt` event channel per the NET driver OIP
//! (OIP-Driver-Net-015) § S2. The future network stack service
//! consults [`NetChannelRegistry::lookup_interface`] /
//! [`NetChannelRegistry::lookup_channel_name`] to obtain the live
//! [`ChannelId`] without sniffing the IPC registry by string.
//!
//! ## Why two channels per interface
//!
//! Each NIC driver exposes exactly two IPC channels per network
//! interface (per `omni_types::net_channel` module):
//!
//! 1. **Command channel** (`omni.svc.net.<iface>`): carries
//!    `NetRequest` → `NetResponse` round-trips from the network
//!    stack to the driver.
//! 2. **Event channel** (`omni.svc.net.<iface>.evt`): carries
//!    unsolicited `NetEvent` messages (received frames, link-state
//!    changes, MAC changes) from the driver to the network stack.
//!
//! Both channel IDs are recorded here at registration time so
//! the network stack can subscribe to both without a second lookup.
//!
//! ## Why a name → id table
//!
//! The kernel [`crate::ipc`] layer is name-agnostic — channels are
//! addressed by [`ChannelId`] only. User space derives a channel name
//! at creation time (the NIC driver picks `omni.svc.net.eth0`) and
//! stores it locally; the kernel never learns about that name. For
//! the NET layer, however, a stable cross-process resolution path is
//! required: a network stack service spawned independently of the
//! NIC driver must locate the channels the driver registered, and
//! the lookup MUST be capability-gated by the channel-name prefix
//! the kernel publishes in
//! [`omni_types::net_channel::NET_CHANNEL_PREFIX`]. This registry
//! is the kernel-side bookkeeping that supports that gate.
//!
//! ## What this module does NOT do
//!
//! - It does not create IPC channels — that is still
//!   [`crate::ipc::KernelIpcRegistry::create_channel_signed`]. The
//!   driver allocates the channels first, then records the mapping
//!   here through the `NetRegister` syscall.
//! - It does not emit any MMIO or touch the page tables — every
//!   operation is a pure-state mutation of a small `Vec`.
//! - It does not implement the NET send/receive protocol — that
//!   lives in user space on both sides of the wire. The registry
//!   only answers "what channel ids are `omni.svc.net.eth0` and
//!   `omni.svc.net.eth0.evt`?".
//!
//! ## Phase-1 scope
//!
//! The Phase-1 driver framework caps the number of simultaneous NIC
//! registrations at [`MAX_NET_CHANNELS`] (16), which is generous for
//! every plausible Phase-1 network topology (one or two virtual NICs,
//! one physical NIC, a loopback tap) without committing to an
//! unbounded allocation. The limit is a denial-of-service defence:
//! a compromised driver looping on
//! [`NetChannelRegistry::register`] will get `RegistryFull` in
//! O(1) rather than exhausting the kernel allocator.
