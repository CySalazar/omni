//! NET channel ABI types (N0.7) — IPC protocol between NIC drivers and the
//! network stack service.
//!
//! This module defines the canonical request/response/event shape carried on
//! the `omni.svc.net.<ifaceN>` IPC channels. The NIC driver is the
//! **producer** that implements this contract; the network stack service is the
//! **consumer** that issues requests and processes events. Future NIC drivers
//! (virtio-net, physical NICs, software taps) MUST expose the same shape so
//! that the network stack mediates against a single contract.
//!
//! ## Why the NET channel is a separate type module
//!
//! The user-space NIC driver, the network stack service, and any diagnostic
//! client (interface inspector, packet-capture tool) all need to encode/decode
//! these types. Placing them in `omni-types` keeps them in the foundational
//! layer that every workspace member is already allowed to depend on, and
//! ensures the wire shape goes through [`crate::wire::encode_canonical`] (the
//! single workspace audit point for serialization, per `OIP-Serde-004`).
//!
//! ## Backward-compatibility policy
//!
//! Backward-compatible additions to [`NetRequest`], [`NetResponse`], and
//! [`NetEvent`] (new variants) MAY land via PR without an OIP. All three
//! enums therefore carry `#[non_exhaustive]` so downstream `match` expressions
//! are forced to provide a `_ =>` arm, and adding a variant does not break
//! source-level consumers.
//!
//! ## Buffer ownership
//!
//! [`NetRequest::SendFrame`] and [`NetEvent::FrameReceived`] carry
//! `bytes_iova`, an IOVA-space address minted by a prior `DmaMap` syscall on
//! the caller side. The NIC driver is the **transient owner** of the buffer
//! for the lifetime of one operation: it reads from `bytes_iova` (send) or
//! writes into `bytes_iova` (receive), then returns a response or emits an
//! event and relinquishes ownership. The caller MUST NOT touch the buffer
//! between issuing the request or registering the receive buffer and observing
//! the completion signal.
//!
//! ## Channel layout
//!
//! Each NIC driver exposes exactly two IPC channels per network interface:
//!
//! 1. **Command channel** (`omni.svc.net.<iface>`): carries
//!    [`NetRequest`] → [`NetResponse`] round-trips.
//! 2. **Event channel** (`omni.svc.net.<iface>.evt`): carries
//!    unsolicited [`NetEvent`] messages from the driver to the network stack.
//!
//! Use [`net_channel_name`] and [`net_event_channel_name`] to construct these
//! names from an interface identifier string.
