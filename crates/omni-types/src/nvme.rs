//! NVMe driver-facing command + event channel ABI types.
//!
//! This module defines the canonical wire shapes carried on the two
//! driver-private NVMe channels per
//! [`OIP-Driver-NVMe-014`](../../../oips/oip-driver-nvme-014.md)
//! § S2 (command channel `omni.driver.nvme.cmd`) and § S3 (event
//! channel `omni.driver.nvme.evt`).
//!
//! The [`crate::blk`] module declares the generic `BlkRequest` /
//! `BlkResponse` types that file-system services consume. This module
//! is the lower-level, NVMe-specific surface that the user-space NVMe
//! driver itself implements between its hardware interaction code and
//! its admin / IO queue logic.
//!
//! ## Why a separate NVMe types module
//!
//! The user-space NVMe driver, the kernel-side BLK / IRQ infrastructure,
//! and any diagnostic client (NVMe inspector, `omni-nvme-cli` analogue)
//! all need to encode/decode these types. Putting them in `omni-types`
//! keeps them in the foundational layer that every workspace member is
//! already allowed to depend on, and ensures the wire shape goes
//! through [`crate::wire::encode_canonical`] (the single workspace
//! audit point for serialization, per OIP-Serde-004).
//!
//! ## Backward-compatibility policy
//!
//! Per OIP-Driver-NVMe-014 § S7, backward-compatible additions to
//! [`NvmeCommand`] / [`NvmeEvent`] / [`IdentifyTarget`] (new variants)
//! MAY land via PR without an OIP. All three enums therefore carry
//! `#[non_exhaustive]` so downstream `match` expressions are forced to
//! provide a `_ =>` arm, and adding a variant does not break
//! source-level consumers.
//!
//! ## Buffer ownership
//!
//! [`NvmeCommand::Identify`], [`NvmeCommand::Read`], [`NvmeCommand::Write`],
//! and [`NvmeCommand::GetLogPage`] carry `buf_iova`, an IOVA-space
//! address minted by a prior `DmaMap` syscall on the caller side. The
//! NVMe driver is the **transient owner** of the buffer between
//! receiving the command and emitting the matching
//! [`NvmeEvent::CommandComplete`]. The caller MUST NOT touch the
//! buffer between issuing the command and observing the completion.
//!
//! ## Correlation
//!
//! Every [`NvmeCommand`] variant that yields a completion carries an
//! `opaque_id: u64` chosen by the client. The driver echoes it
//! verbatim in the matching [`NvmeEvent::CommandComplete`] so that
//! clients can multiplex an arbitrary number of concurrent commands
//! over the single command channel without a separate per-command
//! channel allocation. `opaque_id == 0` is reserved for the driver's
//! own internal correlation (admin commands issued during bring-up).
//!
//! See [`RESERVED_DRIVER_OPAQUE_ID`] for the sentinel value clients
//! MUST NOT use.
//!
//! ## Status-word semantics
//!
//! [`NvmeEvent::CommandComplete::status`] carries the raw 16-bit NVMe
//! status field — the `(Status Code Type:Status Code)` pair NVMe 1.4
//! § 4.5 defines packed into a single `u16` (bits \[14:9\] = SCT, bits
//! \[8:0\] = SC). Clients SHOULD decode it via the NVMe 1.4 spec § 4.5
//! table; helper decoders live alongside the driver-side code in
//! `omni-driver-nvme`, not here, because the table changes with new
//! NVMe spec revisions and this types crate must stay version-stable.
