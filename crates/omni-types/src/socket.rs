//! Socket API types (N3.1) — IPC protocol between userspace programs and the
//! `omni-net` network service.
//!
//! This module defines the canonical request/response shapes carried on the
//! `omni.svc.net.stack` IPC channel. Userspace programs issue
//! [`SocketRequest`] messages and receive [`SocketResponse`] messages;
//! the `omni-net` service is the sole responder.
//!
//! ## Design goals
//!
//! 1. **POSIX-adjacent, not POSIX-identical.** The request vocabulary mirrors
//!    BSD socket semantics (connect, bind, listen, accept, send, recv, etc.)
//!    because userspace consumers will mostly be porting existing software.
//!    However, the surface is deliberately minimal: no `ioctl`, no `setsockopt`
//!    level/optname pairs, no file-descriptor passing. These can be added in
//!    future variants under the `#[non_exhaustive]` policy.
//! 2. **Handles, not file descriptors.** [`SocketHandle`] is an opaque
//!    `u64` assigned by the network service. Userspace programs MUST NOT
//!    interpret it as an OS file-descriptor number; it is only meaningful
//!    on the `omni.svc.net.stack` channel.
//! 3. **No inline data copying in the kernel path.** Large data transfers
//!    (`Send`, `Recv`, etc.) carry `Vec<u8>` in the IPC message for the
//!    initial implementation. A future OIP will migrate to IOVA-based
//!    zero-copy, following the same pattern as [`crate::net_channel`].
//!
//! ## Backward-compatibility policy
//!
//! Both [`SocketRequest`] and [`SocketResponse`] carry `#[non_exhaustive]`.
//! New variants MAY land via PR without an OIP; removing or renaming a
//! variant is a breaking change requiring a Standards-Track OIP.
//!
//! ## Channel constants
//!
//! The IPC channel name is fixed at [`SOCKET_API_CHANNEL`]
//! (`"omni.svc.net.stack"`). Network interface configuration goes on the
//! separate [`NET_CONFIG_CHANNEL`] (`"omni.svc.net.config"`).
