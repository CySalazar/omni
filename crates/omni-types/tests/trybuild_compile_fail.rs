//! Compile-fail test runner.
//!
//! Each `.rs` file under `tests/compile_fail/` MUST fail to compile
//! for the documented reason. These tests transform "convention" into
//! a compiler-enforced invariant — exactly the kind of guarantee a
//! foundational types crate must offer.
//!
//! Run with `cargo test -p omni-types --test trybuild_compile_fail`.
//! No `.stderr` files are checked in: the test passes as long as the
//! fixture fails to compile *for any reason*. This avoids brittle
//! coupling to compiler-version-specific error messages.
