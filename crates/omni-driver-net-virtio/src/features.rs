//! Feature negotiation bit positions for virtio-net.
//!
//! The driver reads the device's `device_feature` 64-bit value from the
//! Common Configuration (virtio 1.0 § 4.1.4.3) across banks 0 and 1, AND
//! it with the union of the constants below, and writes the result back
//! to `driver_feature`. The kernel-resident `OIP-Driver-Net-015` § S4.1
//! step 4 mandates the **v0.3 negotiated subset** as:
//!
//! ```text
//!   VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1
//!   VIRTIO_NET_F_MAC
//!   VIRTIO_NET_F_STATUS
//! ```
//!
//! Additional features (`VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF`, `VIRTIO_NET_F_CSUM`) MAY
//! be added by the bring-up state machine when the developer-authored
//! manifest opts in via the `[net]` table (`tx_checksum_offload`, etc.).
