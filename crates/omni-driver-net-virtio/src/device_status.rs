//! `device_status` byte constants from virtio 1.0 § 2.1.
//!
//! The Common Configuration structure exposes a single `device_status`
//! byte (offset `0x14` per virtio 1.0 § 4.1.4.3, table "Common configuration
//! structure layout") that the driver writes to advance the device through
//! the initialization phases. Each phase is represented by an OR-able bit;
//! the driver MUST write back a status equal to **all previously set bits
//! OR-ed with the next bit**.
//!
//! Sequence per `OIP-Driver-Net-015` § S4.1 (which collapses virtio 1.0 § 3
//! into seven steps for the M1 deliverable):
//!
//! 1. Write [`RESET`] (`0x00`), poll the status until it reads back `0x00`.
//! 2. Write [`ACKNOWLEDGE`] (`0x01`).
//! 3. Write [`ACKNOWLEDGE`] `|` [`DRIVER`] (`0x03`).
//! 4. Negotiate features, then write
//!    [`ACKNOWLEDGE`] `|` [`DRIVER`] `|` [`FEATURES_OK`] (`0x0B`).
//! 5. Re-read; if [`FEATURES_OK`] is not still set, the device has rejected
//!    the negotiated feature subset — abort with [`FAILED`] (`0x80`).
//! 6. Set up virtqueues, post RX buffers.
//! 7. Write
//!    [`ACKNOWLEDGE`] `|` [`DRIVER`] `|` [`FEATURES_OK`] `|` [`DRIVER_OK`]
//!    (`0x0F`). Device is now operational.

/// its internal state on a write of `RESET` to `device_status`.

/// Status bit 2 (`0x04`): the driver is set up and ready to drive the
/// device. Set AFTER virtqueues are configured.

/// Status bit 3 (`0x08`): the driver has acknowledged all the features it
/// understands, and feature negotiation is complete.

/// Status bit 6 (`0x40`): the device has experienced an error from which
/// it cannot recover (set by the device, not the driver).

/// Status bit 7 (`0x80`): something went wrong in the guest, and it has
/// given up on the device. Setting this bit instructs the device to abort.
