//! # `omni-mesh`
//!
//! Federated mesh protocol implementation for OMNI OS.
//!
//! Implements the peer-to-peer mesh that provides Tier 2 collective
//! compute. Specification lives in
//! [`/docs/03-mesh-protocol.md`](../../../docs/03-mesh-protocol.md);
//! this crate is the Rust implementation that conforms to it.
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! Draft v0.1 — scaffold. Implementation arrives in Phase 4 per
//! [`/docs/06-roadmap.md`](../../../docs/06-roadmap.md). v1 release ships
//! with this crate's first stable interfaces.
//!
//! ## Design rationale
//!
//! - **Privacy by construction**: every payload carries a compliance proof
//!   and a TEE-only decryption envelope. Honest nodes (which is every
//!   node running this crate) reject malformed payloads. A non-compliant
//!   fork cannot pollute the mesh.
//! - **No central authority at runtime**: discovery is via Kademlia DHT;
//!   routing is locally decided per node; reputation is computed locally.
//! - **TEE attestation as identity**: a node's identity is its TEE
//!   attestation. Datacenter-cloning attacks are blocked at the
//!   attestation chain level.
//! - **MoE-friendly routing**: per-token expert dispatch with minimal
//!   cross-node traffic.
//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! - [`discovery`] — Kademlia DHT peer discovery.
//! - [`transport`] — QUIC + Noise transport layer.
//! - [`attestation`] — peer attestation handshake.
//! - [`routing`] — workload routing across peers.
//! - [`credits`] — compute credit ledger (gossip-replicated).
//! - [`reputation`] — local reputation scoring.
//! - [`compliance_proof`] — compliance proof envelope handling.
