//! NVMe Admin queue live-submission scaffold.
//!
//! Composes [`crate::ring::SqRing`] + the doorbell offset helper from
//! [`crate::controller_regs::sq_tail_doorbell_offset`] through a
//! [`MmioBackend`] trait so the same code path drives both the live
//! `volatile_write` MMIO on bare-metal and a `MockMmioBackend` in
//! host tests. This is the seam between the pure-state ring math
//! (P6.7.10-pre.9) and the live admin queue's MMIO half.
//!
//! ## Why a trait-based seam
//!
//! The live driver writes the SQ tail doorbell as a 32-bit
//! `volatile_write` to a controller MMIO offset. That access is
//! unavailable in host tests (the offset has no backing memory) but
//! the ring-buffer arithmetic and the SQE serialization steps that
//! precede the doorbell write must be exercised host-side. The
//! [`MmioBackend`] trait lets the test harness substitute an in-memory
//! recorder for the volatile write while sharing every other line of
//! code with the live build.
//!
//! ## What this module does NOT do
//!
//! - It does not drain CQ completions. The live admin CQE drain
//!   reuses [`crate::ring::CqRing`] + a future
//!   [`MmioBackend`] CQ head-doorbell write; that arc lands in a
//!   sibling sub-slice.
//! - It does not allocate the SQ data page. The caller passes a
//!   mutable slice that the driver has already obtained from the
//!   kernel via `DmaMap`; the seam treats it as opaque storage.
