//! External commands implemented as shell builtins (Phase 1).
//!
//! In Phase 1 all "external" commands are compiled into the shell binary and
//! registered alongside the core builtins. This lets the full command set be
//! available immediately without kernel process-spawning support.
//!
//! In Phase 2 (Layer 6) these commands will be extracted into standalone ELF
//! binaries installed at well-known paths (e.g. `/bin/ls`). The shell will
//! spawn them via the kernel process layer rather than calling them directly.
//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! | Module | Commands |
//! |--------|---------|
//! | [`fs_cmds`] | `ls`, `cat`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `touch` |
//! | [`text_cmds`] | `grep`, `head`, `tail`, `wc` |
//! | [`sys_cmds`] | `uname`, `whoami`, `hostname`, `ps`, `kill` |
//! | [`fs_info`] | `df`, `find` |
