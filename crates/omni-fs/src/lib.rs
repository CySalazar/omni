//! # `omni-fs`
//!
//! User-space filesystem service for OMNI OS — **`OmniFS` v0**.
//!
//! Phase-2 scope: the service now includes a real in-memory filesystem
//! ([`InMemoryFs`]) with full CRUD operations (create, read, write, delete,
//! stat, list). The on-disk format types ([`Superblock`], [`Inode`],
//! [`FileType`], [`BlockIntegrityTag`]) are introduced here to establish the
//! wire format that NVMe-backed Phase-3 will serialise to block storage.
//!
//! Phase-1 behaviour (returning [`FsResponse::NotImplemented`]) is preserved
//! when no in-memory filesystem has been formatted via
//! [`FsService::format_volume`], ensuring full backward compatibility.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//!   FsService
//!     ├── VolumeRegistry          (slot name → channel_id map)
//!     ├── InMemoryFs (Option)     (volatile CRUD store, None = Phase-1 stub)
//!     └── dispatch: FsRequest → FsResponse
//!
//!   InMemoryFs
//!     ├── Superblock              (volume metadata)
//!     ├── inodes: BTreeMap<u64, Inode>
//!     ├── path_map: BTreeMap<String, u64>  (path → inode_number)
//!     └── data_blocks: BTreeMap<u64, Vec<u8>>  (block_number → 4096-byte block)
//!
//!   BlkChannelConsumer            (per-volume BLK channel client)
//!     ├── channel_id: u64
//!     ├── next_request_id: u64    (monotonically increasing opaque ID)
//!     └── pending: BTreeMap<u64, BlkRequest>  (in-flight correlation)
//! ```
//!
//! ## BLK channel constants consumed from `omni-types`
//!
//! - [`omni_types::blk::CHANNEL_NAME_PREFIX`] — `"omni.svc.blk."` prefix
//!   used when constructing channel names from disk-slot strings.
//! - [`omni_types::blk::BLOCK_SIZE_BYTES`] — 4 096 B block size asserted in
//!   alignment checks and used as the canonical block size by `InMemoryFs`.
//! - [`omni_types::blk::MAX_BLOCK_COUNT_PER_REQUEST`] — upper bound on the
//!   block count per BLK request (Phase-3 range validation).
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! `OmniFS` v0 Phase-2 — Stream 3 deliverable per
//! `docs/planning/2026-05-21-development-plan.md`.

/// The consumer is responsible for:
///
/// 1. Submitting [`BlkRequest`] values to the driver (Phase 3 actually sends
///    them over IPC; Phase 1–2 only stubs the queue bookkeeping).
/// 2. Tracking in-flight requests by opaque correlation ID so responses can
///    be matched back to their originating request.
/// 3. Correlating incoming [`BlkResponse`] values to the pending request and

/// Correlation IDs are monotonically increasing `u64` values minted by

/// echoes whatever ID the consumer sent, and the consumer uses it to locate
/// the pending entry in the `pending` map.

/// In-memory filesystem for Phase-2 testing and bring-up.
///
/// `InMemoryFs` provides a complete in-memory CRUD filesystem implementation:
/// create, read, write, delete, stat, and list operations backed by
/// `BTreeMap`-indexed data structures. This is the reference implementation
/// that establishes the on-disk format semantics; Phase-3 will replace the
/// in-memory backing store with NVMe BLK channel I/O while keeping the same
/// `FsService` API surface.
///
/// ## Limitations
///
/// - **Volatile**: all state is lost when the struct is dropped. No
///   persistence is provided; this is by design for Phase 2.
/// - **Direct block pointers only**: indirect/double-indirect block pointers
///   are deferred to Phase 3. Files larger than `total_blocks × 4096` bytes
///   will return [`FsError::NoSpace`].
/// - **No ACLs**: access control is deferred to the capability layer (Phase 4).
/// - **No hard links**: each path maps to exactly one inode.
/// - **Timestamps are zero stubs**: no real clock is available in `no_std`
///   without `omni-hal`'s `Clock` abstraction.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use omni_fs::InMemoryFs;
///
/// let mut fs = InMemoryFs::format(1024);
/// assert_eq!(fs.free_blocks(), 1023); // block 0 reserved for superblock
///
/// fs.create_file("/hello.txt").expect("create");
/// fs.write_file("/hello.txt", 0, b"hello world").expect("write");
