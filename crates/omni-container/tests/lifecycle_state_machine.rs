//! Integration tests for the container lifecycle state machine.
//!
//! These tests exercise the state machine end-to-end through the
//! public API of [`omni_container::lifecycle`] and the engine stub.
//! They are the spiritual counterpart to the in-crate unit tests but
//! live in `tests/` so that they only see the public surface — any
//! change that breaks the public state-machine API breaks these
//! tests.
