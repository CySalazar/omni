//! Container lifecycle state machine.
//!
//! See `OIP-Container-006` § 5 ("Lifecycle states"). The state machine
//! has seven states arranged in a directed graph (not a strict linear
//! progression):
//!
//! ```text
//! Pending → Provisioning → Running ⇄ Suspended → Snapshotted
//!                            ↓          ↓                ↓
//!                       Terminating  Terminating    Terminating
//!                            ↓          ↓                ↓
//!                        Terminated ← Terminated ← Terminated
//! ```
//!
//! The machine is enforced by [`ContainerLifecycleState::try_transition`],
//! which returns [`TransitionError`] for any invalid edge. The engine's
//! `provision` / `run` / `suspend` / `resume` / `snapshot` / `terminate`
//! methods route their state changes through this function so that
//! state-machine soundness is checked in one place.

/// All possible lifecycle states for an `OmniContainer`.

/// across the management REST API and audit logs without
/// representation drift. Reordering or renaming variants is a
/// breaking change.
