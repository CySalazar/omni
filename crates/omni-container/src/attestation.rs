//! Per-container attestation surface.
//!
//! See `OIP-Container-006` § 6 ("Per-container TEE attestation").
//!
//! On TEE-capable hardware (TDX / SEV-SNP) the container runs as a
//! confidential VM. The host generates a quote that **separately
//! attests** the container's identity from the host's mesh
//! attestation:
//!
//! - Host TEE measurement (from [`omni_tee::TeeBackend::attest`]).
//! - Guest kernel image hash (signed by Stichting OMNI).
//! - Container OCI image digest.
//! - Granted capability set (canonical encoding, hashed).
//! - Verifier-supplied nonce.
//!
//! Mesh peers verify the quote before accepting work-offload to the
//! container. A node can be a trusted mesh participant overall while
//! specific containers on it are independently attestable.
