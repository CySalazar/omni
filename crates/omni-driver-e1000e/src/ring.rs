//! RX / TX descriptor ring managers for the Intel e1000e driver.
//!
//! This module provides host-testable, `no_std + alloc` implementations of
//! the RX and TX descriptor rings as specified in the Intel 82574L Gigabit
//! Ethernet Controller datasheet:
//!
//! - **RX legacy descriptor** (§ 3.2.3 / § 10.7.1) — 16-byte format with a
//!   buffer address, received length, checksum, status flags, error flags, and
//!   a special field.
//! - **TX legacy descriptor** (§ 3.3.3 / § 10.8.1) — 16-byte format with a
//!   buffer address, length, checksum-offset, command bits, status/reserved,
//!   checksum-start, and a special field.
//!
//! ## Ring semantics
//!
//! Both rings operate on the standard head/tail convention used by the e1000e
//! hardware:
//!
//! - **Head** (`RDH` / `TDH`): advanced by hardware as it consumes descriptors.
//! - **Tail** (`RDT` / `TDT`): advanced by software after posting buffers (RX)
//!   or submitting frames (TX).
//!
//! Because this crate runs as a host-testable library without live hardware,
//! the rings use `Vec<{Rx,Tx}Descriptor>` and software-managed head/tail
//! pointers. The bootable image sibling (`omni-driver-e1000e-image`, P6.7.8.7)
//! hands the ring base address to the controller via `RDBAL`/`RDBAH`/`RDLEN`
//! and `TDBAL`/`TDBAH`/`TDLEN` MMIO writes.
//!
//! ## No `unsafe`
//!
//! All index arithmetic is performed with explicit modulo wrapping. No
//! pointer arithmetic or `unsafe` blocks are present; the `Vec` allocation
//! ensures bounds are maintained by the Rust runtime.
//!
