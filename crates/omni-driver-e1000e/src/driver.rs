//! Main driver struct and TX/RX dispatch for the Intel e1000e.
//!
//! This module provides [`E1000eDriver`] — the central state object that ties
//! together the [`crate::ring::RxDescriptorRing`] and
//! [`crate::ring::TxDescriptorRing`] ring managers with the NET channel IPC
//! protocol defined in [`omni_types::net_channel`].
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! `E1000eDriver` is intentionally free of hardware MMIO. All hardware
//! interactions (register writes, DMA mapping, IRQ attachment) live in the
//! bootable image sibling `omni-driver-e1000e-image` (P6.7.8.7). This crate
//! stays a host-testable `no_std + alloc` library:
//!
//! - The test suite exercises `handle_request`, `send_frame`, `poll_rx`, and
//!   `poll_tx_completions` entirely in software without hardware or MMIO.
//! - The bootable image wraps `E1000eDriver` and calls its methods in response
//!   to real IRQs and IPC messages.
//!
//! ## State machine
//!
//! The driver tracks its lifecycle via [`DriverState`]. After construction
//! (`new`) the driver starts in [`DriverState::Ready`] — the host-testable
//! model assumes the bring-up FSM ([`crate::bringup`]) has already completed
//! successfully before the `E1000eDriver` is handed any traffic. In the
//! bootable image the bring-up FSM transitions the driver from `Uninitialized`
//! to `Ready`.
//!
//! ## Buffer model
//!
//! RX receive buffers are simulated as `Vec<Vec<u8>>` pre-allocated in `new`.
//! Each `Vec<u8>` is `rx_buffer_size` bytes. In the bootable image the outer
//! `Vec` is replaced by DMA-mapped pages whose IOVAs are posted into the RX
//! ring, but the host-testable layer uses heap allocations to exercise the
//! same descriptor-ring paths.
//!
