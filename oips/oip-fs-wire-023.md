# OIP-FS-Wire-023 — OmniFS On-Disk Format v1

## Abstract

This OIP defines the on-disk format for OmniFS v1, the native filesystem
of OMNI OS. The format comprises four structural layers: a **Superblock**
identifying the volume and tracking free-space metadata, an **Inode
B+-tree** mapping file/directory metadata to block pointers, a
**Copy-on-Write (CoW) block allocator** ensuring crash consistency
without a journal, and per-block **AEAD integrity tags** providing
tamper evidence for all stored data.

## Motivation

### M1. OmniFS needs an on-disk format to persist AI models

The Phase 2 AI Runtime Service loads models via `ModelRegistry::load_from_bytes`.
Today, model bytes arrive from test fixtures. Production deployment requires
models to be stored on NVMe media and loaded via the BLK channel. The on-disk
format is the bridge between raw NVMe blocks and the structured file abstraction
that `ModelRegistry` expects.

### M2. Integrity at the block level prevents silent corruption

AI model weights are high-value data: a single flipped bit can cause
catastrophic inference errors with no obvious error signal. AEAD tags per
block provide tamper evidence (accidental corruption) and tamper resistance
(adversarial modification of model weights on disk).

### M3. CoW allocation enables crash-safe writes without journaling

A traditional journal doubles write amplification. Copy-on-Write semantics
achieve crash consistency by never overwriting live data: new blocks are
written to free space, the inode pointer is atomically updated, and old
blocks are freed. If the system crashes mid-write, either the old or new
state is valid — never a torn intermediate.

## Specification

### S1. Superblock (Block 0)

The superblock occupies the first 4 KiB block of the volume.

| Offset | Size | Field | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | 8 | `magic` | `b"OMNIFS01"` — format identifier |
| 8 | 4 | `version` | Format version (1 for this OIP) |
| 12 | 4 | `block_size` | Block size in bytes (MUST be 4096) |
| 16 | 8 | `total_blocks` | Total number of blocks on the volume |
| 24 | 8 | `free_blocks` | Number of unallocated blocks |
| 32 | 8 | `inode_count` | Total number of allocated inodes |
| 40 | 8 | `root_inode` | Inode number of the root directory |
| 48 | 8 | `created_at` | Volume creation timestamp (OMNI HAL epoch) |
| 56 | 8 | `aead_key_id` | Key identifier for block-level AEAD tags |

Bytes 64–4095 are reserved (zeroed). The superblock is written during
`mkfs` and updated on every metadata-modifying operation.

### S2. Inode structure

Each inode occupies 256 bytes and contains:

| Offset | Size | Field | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | 8 | `inode_number` | Unique inode identifier |
| 8 | 1 | `file_type` | 0 = regular file, 1 = directory |
| 9 | 7 | _reserved_ | Padding (zeroed) |
| 16 | 8 | `size` | File size in bytes |
| 24 | 4 | `block_count` | Number of allocated blocks |
| 28 | 4 | _reserved_ | Padding |
| 32 | 8 | `created` | Creation timestamp |
| 40 | 8 | `modified` | Last-modified timestamp |
| 48 | 8×12 | `direct_blocks` | 12 direct block pointers |
| 144 | 8 | `indirect_block` | Single-indirect block pointer |
| 152 | 8 | `double_indirect` | Double-indirect block pointer |
| 160 | 96 | `name` | UTF-8 file name (null-padded, max 95 chars) |

Maximum file size with direct blocks only: 12 × 4096 = 48 KiB.
With single indirect (512 entries × 4096): ~2 MiB.
With double indirect: ~1 GiB. Sufficient for Phase 2 model files.

### S3. CoW block allocator

Block allocation follows Copy-on-Write semantics:

1. **Write**: allocate a new block from the free list, write data to it,
   update the inode to point to the new block, free the old block.
2. **Free list**: a bitmap stored in blocks 1–N (one bit per data block).
   Block 0 is the superblock; bitmap blocks start at block 1.
3. **Atomic pointer update**: the inode's block pointer is updated in a
   single 8-byte write, which is atomic on NVMe (per NVM Express spec
   §4.2 — writes ≤ atomic write unit are guaranteed atomic).

### S4. AEAD integrity tags

Every data block has an associated 16-byte AEAD tag stored in a
dedicated integrity region:

- Tag computation: `AEAD-Encrypt(key, nonce=block_number, data=block_data)`
- Phase 2 stub: tags are zeroed (no real encryption key available).
- Phase 3+: tags are computed using the TEE-sealed key identified by
  `superblock.aead_key_id`.

Verification is mandatory on read: if the computed tag does not match
the stored tag, the read returns `FsError::IntegrityViolation`.

## Rationale

### R1. Why B+-tree for inodes, not a flat table

A flat inode table (ext4-style) wastes space when the filesystem has few
files (common for AI model storage — tens of large files). A B+-tree
grows proportionally to the number of files and provides O(log n) lookup
by inode number. For the Phase 2 in-memory implementation, `BTreeMap` is
used directly.

### R2. Why CoW instead of a journal

CoW avoids the 2× write amplification of journaling and naturally
produces snapshots (the old blocks remain valid until freed). This aligns
with OMNI OS's undo/rollback philosophy (OIP-007 §6) — a filesystem-level
rollback is simply "revert the inode pointer to the previous block set."

## Test Cases

- **T1.** Format a volume with `InMemoryFs::format(1024)` → superblock
  magic is `b"OMNIFS01"`, version is 1, root inode exists.
- **T2.** Create a file, write 8 KiB, read back → data matches.
- **T3.** Write at offset 4096, read at offset 0 → first block is zero,
  second block has the written data.
- **T4.** Delete a file → `free_blocks` increases, `stat` returns `NotFound`.
- **T5.** Block integrity tag computation and verification (stub: zeroed tags).
- **T6.** End-to-end: format → create → write → stat → read → delete → verify free.

## Security Considerations

- AEAD tags are mandatory; a volume without tags is considered corrupted.
- The AEAD key MUST be TEE-sealed; compromise of the key voids integrity.
- CoW semantics mean deleted data remains on disk until the block is
  reused; secure deletion requires block zeroing (Phase 3).

## Privacy Considerations

- File names in inodes may contain PII; encryption-at-rest (via
  `omni-tokenization`) is recommended for user-data volumes.
