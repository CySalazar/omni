# Formal Threat Model

**Status:** Draft v0.1
**Companion to:** [04-security-model.md](./04-security-model.md)

This document is the formal threat model for OMNI OS. It complements the high-level security model with structured analysis using **STRIDE** for security threats and **LINDDUN** for privacy threats, attack-tree decomposition for high-severity scenarios, and a risk matrix mapping threats to mitigations.

It is a living document. Every architectural change that affects trust boundaries, data flows, or assets MUST trigger a review of this threat model.

---

## 1. Purpose and methodology

### Purpose

- Enumerate threats systematically before they are exploited.
- Provide a shared vocabulary for engineers, reviewers, and auditors.
- Support OIP discussions where security and privacy trade-offs are involved.
- Drive prioritization of security work in each phase of the roadmap.

### Methodology

- **STRIDE** — applied to security threats per component (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege).
- **LINDDUN** — applied to privacy threats specific to mesh and AI workloads (Linkability, Identifiability, Non-repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure, Unawareness, Non-compliance).
- **Attack trees** for high-priority threats: decompose the goal into refinements until each leaf is either preventable, detectable, or accepted.
- **Risk matrix**: each threat scored on severity (1–5) × likelihood (1–5). Risk = severity × likelihood.

### Severity scale

| Level | Label | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | Critical | System-wide compromise; protocol guarantees broken; mass-user impact |
| 4 | High | Single-node compromise leading to PII exposure or service outage |
| 3 | Medium | Limited compromise mitigable in a single deployment |
| 2 | Low | Annoyance; degrades UX without security impact |
| 1 | Informational | Theoretical / not currently exploitable |

### Likelihood scale

| Level | Label | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | Near-certain | Will happen during normal operation without mitigation |
| 4 | Likely | Reasonable attacker can execute |
| 3 | Possible | Sophisticated attacker can execute |
| 2 | Unlikely | Requires nation-state-level resources |
| 1 | Remote | Theoretical with no known practical path |

Risk **>= 12** is **High** and must be mitigated before v1.0. Risk **>= 16** is **Critical** and is a release-blocker.

## 2. System decomposition

### Trust boundaries

OMNI OS has six primary trust boundaries:

1. **User application ↔ AI Runtime Service**: capability-checked syscalls.
2. **User-space service ↔ Microkernel**: IPC with capability validation.
3. **Local node ↔ Personal Cluster peers**: mTLS over LAN, mutual TEE attestation.
4. **Local node ↔ Federated Mesh peers**: QUIC + Noise, mutual TEE attestation, compliance proofs on every payload.
5. **Local node ↔ Commercial cloud**: opt-in TLS connection with explicit user consent and privacy-budget accounting.
6. **TEE ↔ Host OS on a node**: TEE protects against the host OS itself.

### Primary assets

| Asset | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability |
|---|---|---|---|
| User PII | Critical | High | Medium |
| User AI conversations | High | High | Medium |
| Capability tokens | High | Critical | Low |
| Model weights (in-flight) | Medium | Critical | Low |
| Compute credit ledger | Low | High | Medium |
| Reputation scores | Low | High | Low |
| Mesh routing tables | Low | Medium | Medium |
| Audit logs | High | Critical | High |

### Data flows (high-level)

## 3. Attacker profiles

Six attacker classes from [04-security-model.md](./04-security-model.md), expanded.

### A1 — Malicious local app
- **Origin:** user-installed (sideloaded or from a marketplace).
- **Capabilities:** runs in user space; can call OS APIs; cannot violate kernel capability checks.
- **Motivation:** data exfiltration, cryptojacking, ransomware, surveillance.
- **Examples:** trojanized productivity app; legitimate app with malicious update; exploit chain via memory bug.

### A2 — Untrusted content
- **Origin:** files, web pages, emails, attachments, clipboard, IPC payloads from untrusted sources.
- **Capabilities:** content reaches the model as input; may contain instructions designed to hijack the model.
- **Motivation:** cross-context data exfiltration, action hijacking, manipulation of agent behavior.
- **Examples:** prompt-injection in a webpage processed by an agent; PDF with hidden instructions; email with embedded model directives.

### A3 — Supply chain
- **Origin:** upstream model publishers, dependency authors, hardware vendors.
- **Capabilities:** controls inputs to the build / model pipeline.
- **Motivation:** strategic backdoor placement, IP theft, mass surveillance.
- **Examples:** backdoored model weights (BadNets); compromised crate on crates.io; malicious firmware update.

### A4 — Curious cloud
- **Origin:** Tier 3 commercial inference provider, when used.
- **Capabilities:** sees the prompts the user sent; logs them.
- **Motivation:** commercial profiling, regulatory compulsion, data resale.
- **Examples:** any major commercial LLM API.

### A5 — Physical attacker
- **Origin:** has physical or near-physical access to a device.
- **Capabilities:** cold boot attacks, JTAG, side-channel measurement, firmware downgrade.
- **Motivation:** targeted surveillance, key extraction, evidence collection.
- **Examples:** border seizure, theft, "evil maid" attack on a laptop.

### A6 — Misaligned model
- **Origin:** the AI model itself, possibly without the publisher's awareness.
- **Capabilities:** generates outputs that the model "thinks" satisfy its training objective but are harmful in practice.
- **Motivation:** N/A (model has no intent in the human sense, but its outputs can still be harmful).
- **Examples:** model that produces deceptive text; model that follows injected instructions despite training; model with reward hacking.

## 4. STRIDE analysis per component

For each major component, threats are listed by STRIDE category. Each threat has an ID, severity (S), likelihood (L), and risk score (S × L). Mitigations link to relevant sections in [04-security-model.md](./04-security-model.md).

## 5. LINDDUN privacy analysis

LINDDUN focuses on privacy threats. Applied to the mesh and AI workloads, where they are most acute.

### Linkability

**L-1**: Two queries from the same user can be linked across mesh peers.
- **Severity 4, Likelihood 3, Risk 12.**
- Mitigation: per-session token re-scrambling in tokenization vault; onion routing for high-sensitivity workloads.

**L-2**: A user's reputation history reveals their query patterns.
- **Severity 2, Likelihood 4, Risk 8.**
- Mitigation: reputation aggregates ignore content; only outcomes (success/failure of inference verification).

### Identifiability

**I-1**: TEE attestation report contains hardware fingerprints that identify a specific device.
- **Severity 3, Likelihood 5, Risk 15.**
- Mitigation: attestation reports are accepted only by mesh peers, not third parties; no transitive disclosure.

**I-2**: Routing metadata (even if FPE-encrypted) leaks source identity over time.
- **Severity 3, Likelihood 3, Risk 9.**
- Mitigation: rotating session IDs; padding traffic; optional onion routing.

### Non-repudiation

**N-1**: Inference requests are signed and gossiped — a user cannot plausibly deny having issued a query.
- **Severity 2, Likelihood 4, Risk 8.**
- Mitigation: signatures are TEE-internal; queries to other peers carry only opaque session IDs, not user-bound credentials.

### Detectability

**D-1**: Pattern of mesh participation reveals "user is online and using AI now".
- **Severity 2, Likelihood 5, Risk 10.**
- Mitigation: persistent low-level traffic ("padding") to obscure presence; opt-in; not v1 priority.

### Disclosure of information

**DI-1**: PII exfiltration via the inference channel (covers the headline scenario).
- **Severity 5, Likelihood 4, Risk 20** without mitigation.
- Mitigation: tokenization (5/5), TEE-only decryption envelope (5/5), compliance proof rejection of cleartext PII (5/5). With mitigations: residual risk 5 (Severity 5 × Likelihood 1).

**DI-2**: Inference output (de-tokenized response) leaked to non-user processes.
- **Severity 5, Likelihood 2, Risk 10.**
- Mitigation: response stays in user's TEE until decoded by the requesting application's capability scope.

### Unawareness

**U-1**: User does not understand that participating in the mesh exposes some metadata.
- **Severity 2, Likelihood 4, Risk 8.**
- Mitigation: clear opt-in flow; persistent UI indicator; readable settings panel.

### Non-compliance

**NC-1**: Mesh operation runs afoul of GDPR/HIPAA in some jurisdictions.
- **Severity 3, Likelihood 3, Risk 9.**
- Mitigation: protocol-enforced PII handling means OMNI OS can claim privacy-by-design; per-jurisdiction guidance in `/docs` (TODO); legal counsel engagement.

        └── Mitigation: capability tokens are bound to TEE attestation;
            useless to a different attestation
```

### Tree 6.4 — Goal: introduce a model backdoor

```
Goal: Backdoored model silently affects outputs on trigger
├── Path A: Compromise the model publisher
│   ├── A1: Infiltrate the publishing organization
│   │   └── Mitigation: out of OMNI OS direct scope; partial mitigation

## 7. Risk matrix

Threats with risk score ≥ 12 are summarized here. All MUST be mitigated to acceptable residual risk before v1.0 release. Residual risk after planned mitigation is in parentheses.

| ID | Threat | Risk | Residual after mitigation |
|----|--------|------|---------------------------|
| R-E-1 | Prompt injection escalation | 20 | 5 |
| DI-1 | PII exfiltration via inference | 20 | 5 |
| R-I-1 | Inference cache cross-agent leak | 16 | 4 |
| M-S-2 | Mesh Sybil attack | 16 | 6 |
| TE-I-1 | TEE side-channel (academic class) | 15 | 9 (residual is real; ongoing concern) |
| I-1 | Hardware fingerprint identifiability | 15 | 6 |
| K-I-1 | Microkernel side-channel | 12 | 4 |
| K-D-1 | Microkernel resource exhaustion DoS | 12 | 4 |
| R-S-1 | Stolen capability token | 12 | 3 |
| R-D-1 | Pathological inference DoS | 12 | 4 |
| L-1 | Mesh query linkability | 12 | 6 |
| M-T-2 | Routing table poisoning | 12 | 4 |
| M-I-2 | Mesh traffic analysis | 12 | 6 |
| M-D-1 | Compliance proof flood | 12 | 4 |
| M-E-1 | Reputation collusion | 12 | 6 |

Persistent residual risks above 6 require mitigation iteration before v1.0 ship.

---

## 8. Mitigation status

For every threat listed above, mitigations exist either as:

- **Implemented** (will be marked when phase work delivers them)
- **Planned** (designed and scheduled in roadmap)
- **Open** (designed direction but not yet detailed)

Currently (Draft v0.1) all mitigations are **planned** — implementation begins in Phase 1.

A mitigation status tracker will be added to `/docs/security-mitigations.md` (TODO) as Phase 1 starts. It will map each threat ID to:
- Component owning the mitigation
- Phase delivery
- Test coverage
- Audit status

---

## 9. Open issues

These are gaps in the threat model itself, requiring further analysis:

- **OI-1**: Threat modeling for federated training (deferred to v2; will require LINDDUN extension for gradient leakage).
- **OI-2**: Threat model for the OMNI OS update process (signed releases, rollback, downgrade attacks).
- **OI-3**: Insider-threat model for Stichting OMNI itself (e.g., compromised key signing the reference implementation).
- **OI-4**: Cross-jurisdiction legal threats (e.g., compelled-backdoor scenarios). Out of pure technical scope but affect overall security posture.
- **OI-5**: Threat model for the WASM agent sandbox (depends on choice between WASM and process-level isolation).
- **OI-6**: Quantum-attack timeline modeling — specifically when classical crypto becomes unsafe.

---

## 10. Review cadence

This document is reviewed:

- At the close of every roadmap phase.
- Before any release (`v0.x`, `v1.0`, etc.).
- After any external security audit.
- Whenever the `Open issues` section grows by ≥ 3 entries.
- Whenever a mitigation moves from `Planned` to `Implemented`.

Each review produces an OIP if substantive changes are made.
