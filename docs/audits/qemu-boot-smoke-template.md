# QEMU boot smoke — `<YYYY-MM-DD>`

K5 gate of `OIP-Kernel-003` § 3 — `kernel-runner` boots under QEMU+OVMF
and emits the canonical banner sequence on the serial console.

## Environment

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Date (UTC)** | `<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ>` |
| **Host** | `<distro + version, e.g., Ubuntu 24.04.1>` |
| **Kernel (host)** | `<uname -r>` |
| **Rust toolchain** | `<rustc --version --verbose | head -1>` |
| **`bootimage` version** | `<bootimage --version>` |
| **`bootloader` crate** | `<from Cargo.lock>` |
| **`bootloader_api` crate** | `<from Cargo.lock>` |
| **QEMU version** | `<qemu-system-x86_64 --version | head -1>` |
| **OVMF version** | `<dpkg -s ovmf | grep Version, or "edk2-stable<year>" on Arch>` |
| **kernel-runner commit** | `<git rev-parse HEAD>` (branch `<branch>`) |
| **CI run URL** | `<https://github.com/CySalazar/omni/actions/runs/...>` |

## Invocation

```bash
bash scripts/qemu-boot-smoke.sh --release
```

(or, equivalently, the `qemu-boot-smoke` workflow job — paste the URL above.)

## Result

**`<PASS | FAIL>`** — boot completed in `<NN.NNN>` seconds (wall clock).

## Captured serial output

Verbatim, including QEMU's startup banner:

```text
<paste the full stdout/stderr capture of qemu-boot-smoke.sh here>
```

## Banner-sequence assertion

The smoke script asserts that the five lines below appear, in order,
on the serial console. Tick each line on a successful run.

- [ ] `[OMNI OS] kernel-runner: entry_point reached.`
- [ ] `[OMNI OS] early console (COM1) is live.`
- [ ] `[OMNI OS] proceeding to heap init + kmain.`
- [ ] `[OMNI OS] kmain entered.`
- [ ] `[OMNI OS] halting (K4 scope ends here).`

Lines 1–3 are emitted by `kernel-runner/src/early_console.rs::
announce_boot`; lines 4–5 are emitted by `omni_kernel::kmain` (with
the kernel version + memory-region count between them — assertion
ignores those values, only the framing lines).

## Memory map observed

Paste the `kmain`-reported region count (the integer on the line
`[OMNI OS] memory regions: <N>` between lines 4 and 5):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Region count | `<N>` |
| `MIN_HEAP_BYTES` met by `pick_region` | `<YES — no panic>` |

If `<NO — panic-on-no-region>`, paste the structured panic record
(postcard-encoded bytes are decoded by the smoke script for human
readability) into the section below.

## Anomalies / follow-ups

| Severity | Description | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `<low|med|high>` | `<observation>` | `<file an issue, fold into next OIP, ignore>` |

## Sign-off

| Role | Name | Date |
|---|---|---|
| Smoke-test runner | `<cySalazar>` | `<YYYY-MM-DD>` |
| Editor body (Seat 1) | `<cySalazar>` | `<YYYY-MM-DD>` |

*This file is part of the K5 audit trail mandated by `OIP-Kernel-003`
§ 3 (last row of the K1–K5 table). Each successful smoke run on `main`
produces a new audit file named
`docs/audits/qemu-boot-smoke-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`. Failures land in the
same directory with a `FAIL` status — they are not deleted, since the
audit trail must record both successes and regressions.*
