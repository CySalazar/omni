# OMNI OS — Documentation Index

> Technical documentation for OMNI OS. All documents are `Draft v0.1` until the project's v0.1 specification is formally released.

**Current status:** Design phase, May 2026.

## Documents

| # | Document | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | [Vision and principles](./01-vision.md) | Draft v0.1 | Mission, target audience, core principles |

| 05 | [Governance](./05-governance.md) | Draft v0.1 | 3-layer model, OIP process, Foundation structure |
| 06 | [Roadmap](./06-roadmap.md) | Draft v0.1 | Phases, milestones, version scope |
| 07 | [Hardware requirements](./07-hardware-requirements.md) | Draft v0.1 | Baseline, supported and excluded platforms |
| 08 | [Funding policy](./08-funding-policy.md) | Draft v0.1 | Accepted and excluded funding sources |
| 09 | [Tech specifications](./09-tech-specifications.md) | Draft v0.1 | Languages, libraries, exact versions |

## Subdirectories

In addition to the numbered design documents above, `/docs/` hosts several
subdirectories created during P3–P5 to keep the root tidy:

| Path | Purpose | First populated |
|---|---|---|
| [`/docs/protocol/`](./protocol/) | Formal wire-level specifications (handshake, compliance proof format, eventually IPC ABI). Authoritative over high-level prose elsewhere. | 2026-05-10 (P3.1) |
| [`/docs/audits/`](./audits/) | Independent audit reports, closure reports (e.g. P0), cryptographer-engagement template, BDFL veto log (created on first veto). | 2026-05-10 |
| [`/docs/legal/`](./legal/) | Stichting OMNI bylaws draft, NL notary execution checklist. Authoritative version of bylaws will be the Dutch notarial deed; this is the working English draft. | 2026-05-10 (P4.1) |
| [`/docs/funding/`](./funding/) | Pitch deck, one-pager, grant application drafts (NLnet, Mozilla MOSS, Sloan, Open Philanthropy), sponsor tier menu. | 2026-05-10 (P4.2) |
| [`/docs/hiring/`](./hiring/) | Role descriptions (kernel engineer, networking engineer, cryptographer) and public salary bands. | 2026-05-10 (P4.4) |

Related directories outside `/docs/`:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`/oips/`](../oips/) | OMNI Improvement Proposals. Authoritative for protocol / process decisions. |
| [`/protocol-proofs/`](../protocol-proofs/) | Tamarin / ProVerif / TLA+ formal proof artifacts for protocol-level claims. |
| [`/brand/`](../brand/) | OMNI / OMNI Foundation brand pack — strategy, voice, logos, palette, typography, icons, templates, brand book PDF. Authoritative for visual and verbal identity. |

## Suggested reading order

For new contributors:

1. Start with [Vision](./01-vision.md) for context and motivation.
2. Read [Architecture](./02-architecture.md) for the big picture.
3. Dive into [Security model](./04-security-model.md) and [Mesh protocol](./03-mesh-protocol.md) for technical depth.
4. Consult [Glossary](./10-glossary.md) for unfamiliar terms.
5. See [Governance](./05-governance.md) and [Funding policy](./08-funding-policy.md) for project organization.

For implementers:
- [Tech specifications](./09-tech-specifications.md) for exact dependency versions.
- [Hardware requirements](./07-hardware-requirements.md) for target platforms.
- [Roadmap](./06-roadmap.md) for phase-by-phase scope.

## Maintenance policy

- Documentation lives alongside code in the same repository.
- Code changes that affect architecture, protocol, or external behavior MUST be accompanied by documentation updates in the same change set.
- Documentation versioning follows the project's semantic versioning.
- All documents track their status (`Draft`, `Review`, `Final`, `Deprecated`).

## OIP process

Substantive changes to architecture, protocol, or governance require an OMNI Improvement Proposal (OIP). See [Governance](./05-governance.md) for the OIP workflow.
